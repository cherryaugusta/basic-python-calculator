# Basic Python Calculator

## Overview

This project is a clean and well-structured **basic Python calculator** implemented using object-oriented programming principles.  
It demonstrates how even a simple problem can be solved using readable, maintainable, and professional Python code.

The calculator runs in the command line and allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations interactively.

## Features

- Object-oriented design using a `Calculator` class
- Safe handling of invalid numeric input
- Menu-driven command-line interface
- Graceful handling of division by zero
- Clear separation of concerns
- Fully runnable as a standalone Python script

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external dependencies

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
python basic_calculator.py
```

## Example Usage

Enter a: 10
Enter b: 5

Choose an operation:
1 - Addition
2 - Subtraction
3 - Multiplication
4 - Division
0 - Restart
Any other key - Exit

Your choice: 4
Result: 2.0

## Design Highlights

• Uses a class to encapsulate arithmetic behavior
• Validates user input to prevent runtime crashes
• Keeps logic modular and readable
• Avoids unnecessary complexity while maintaining clarity
• Easily extensible for future enhancements

## Possible Extensions

This project is intentionally kept simple, but it can be extended with:
• Calculation history
• Memory functions
• Unit tests
• Command-line arguments
• Graphical user interface (GUI)
• Modular package structure
